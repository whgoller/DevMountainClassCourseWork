JQuery 

framework - tells us how to structure our app
library...

DOM (Document Object model) - when we write HTML, we are crating what will become the DOM
	when our browsers download HTML from a server, they render it into the DOM

JQuery  - what even is a jQuery?
xbrowser polyfil
DOM manipulator
ajax handler
Web app builder?



xbrowser polyfil - jQuery's popularity was partly due to the fact that it made writing javascript easier to do over multiple bowsers.

DOM manipulator - JQuery's primary use however is for basic DOM manipulations.

How it works:
Selectors
Events 
Methods

When we use the $, we .....


Events

Right here we are saying: "h.....

Methods
in jQuery we have a bunch of methods we can use to mainpulate things. all of these methods are called in a callback that runs once the even has been triggered.....


Things that can be selected
ID - '#nameOfId'
Class - '.nameOfClass'
Elements - 'nameOfElement' (like body or div)
Multiple - ''

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
	allows us to change data to and from our servers asynchronously

CRUD - the basic building blocks of any web application!
CREATE 
READ 
UPDATE 
DESTROY


Ajax 4 verbs for the basic building blocks.
CREATE  - POST
READ  - GET
UPDATE - PUT
DESTROY - DELETE


API - Application programming interface
Allows us to interface with someones's server / data!

api in its purist form is just a URL

//jquery has an ajax method that takes an object... 
$.ajax({
	url: 'http://www.google.com' //url has to be like that and it is a key...
})


a regular url will give compiled code...
an api url will give you pure data...

if you add .json at the end of an api url you will get the data.

www.reddit.com/r/todayILearned.json //this will give redit api for the page

examples: 
$.ajax({
	url: 'http://reddit.com/r/todayilearned.json',
	method: 'GET' //this is a call to get the data if the call is success full the callback function would run.
	success: function(data){ 
		console.log(data);
	}
});



$.ajax({
	url: 'http://reddit.com/r/todayilearned.json',
	method: 'POST'
	data: {name:'ean'} 
	success: function(data){ 
		return data
	}
});


can use Postman - REST Client in chrome web app tools 
example
https://api.github.com/users/whgoller


reqr.es is a dummy database that you can use to practice ajax calls.
