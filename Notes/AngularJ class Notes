The service is what stands between the database and the app.
view - controller - service and service - controller - view
controller reloads when the page reloads the service does not.


/service could also be factory, provider or service... the syntax is a little bit different for each



Ryan Shaw  works at instructure....
dependency injection is basically importing external code to be used in the current code..
makes it so you don't have to use
var specialModule = require('specialModule)
var other = require('other')


this code is also doing the above.
var app = angular.module('jsbin', []);
app.controller('DemoCtrl', function(specialModule, other, $http, $q){
    $q
    $http
    this.name = 'World';
})
