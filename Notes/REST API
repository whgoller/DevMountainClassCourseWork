API vs REST API




REST Api

CRUD:
GET
PUT
POST
DELETE

PUT vs POST - POST hits a generic endpoint to call a method or create data.
mysite.com/newuser /If we don't know the specifiec url then we use POST and let the server handle it.
PUT hits a more specific endpoint. mysite.com/users/132537 / It uses a specific URL
